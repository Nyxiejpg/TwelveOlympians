    <p> <strong> Core Olympians </strong> </p>
    <p> The Olympians were a race of deities, primarily consisting of a third and fourth generation of immortal beings, worshipped as the principal gods of the Greek pantheon and so named because of their residency atop Mount Olympus.<p>
    <p> They gained their supremacy in a ten-year-long war of gods, in which <i>Zeus </i> led his siblings to victory over the previous generation of ruling gods, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titans_(mythology)"> <i>the Titans</i>. </a> </p>
    <p> They were a family of gods, the most important consisting of the first generation of Olympians, offspring of the Titans <i>Cronus</i> and <i>Rhea</i>: <i>Zeus</i>, <i>Poseidon</i>, <i>Hera</i>, <i>Demeter</i> and <i>Hestia</i>, along with the principal offspring of <i>Zeus</i>: <i>Athena</i>, <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Artemis</i>, <i>Ares</i>, <i> Aphrodite</i>, <i>Hephaestus</i>, <i> Hermes</i>, and <i>Dionysus</i>. </p>
    <p> Although <i>Hades</i> was a major deity in the Greek pantheon, and was the brother of <i>Zeus</i> and the other first generation of Olympians, his realm was far away from Olympus in the underworld, and thus he was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians. </p>
    <p> Olympic gods can be contrasted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chthonic"> chthonic gods</a>, including <i>Hades</i>, by mode of sacrifice, the latter receiving sacrifices in a <i lang="el"> bothros</i> ("pit") or <i lang="el"> megaron </i> ("sunken chamber") rather than at an altar. </p>
