    <p> <strong> The Twelve Olympians </strong> </p>
    <p> In ancient Greek religion and mythology, the <strong> Twelve Olympians </strong> are the major deities of the Greek pantheon, commonly considered to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus"><em>Zeus</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera"><em>Hera</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon"><i>Poseidon</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter"><i>Demeter</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena"><i>Athena</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo"> <i>Apollo</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis"> <i>Artemis</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares"><i>Ares</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus"> <i>Hephaestus</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite"><i>Aphrodite</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes"><i>Hermes</i></a>, and either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia"><i>Hestia</i></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus"> <i>Dionysus</i></a>.</p>
    <p> They were called Olympians because, according to tradition, they resided on <strong>Mount Olympus</strong>. </p>
    <p> Although <i>Hades</i> was a major ancient Greek god, and was the brother of the first generation of Olympians (<i>Zeus</i>, <i>Poseidon</i>, <i>Hera</i>, <i>Demeter</i>, and <i>Hestia</i>), his realm was the underworld, far from Olympus, and thus was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians.</p>
    <p> Besides the twelve Olympians, there were many other cultic groupings of twelve gods. </p>
    <p> <strong> Olympians </strong> </p>
    <p> The Olympians were a race of deities, primarily consisting of a third and fourth generation of immortal beings, worshipped as the principal gods of the Greek pantheon and so named because of their residency atop Mount Olympus.<p>
    <p> They gained their supremacy in a ten-year-long war of gods, in which <i>Zeus </i> led his siblings to victory over the previous generation of ruling gods, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titans_(mythology)"> <i>the Titans</i>. </a> </p>
    <p> They were a family of gods, the most important consisting of the first generation of Olympians, offspring of the Titans <i>Cronus</i> and <i>Rhea</i>: <i>Zeus</i>, <i>Poseidon</i>, <i>Hera</i>, <i>Demeter</i> and <i>Hestia</i>, along with the principal offspring of <i>Zeus</i>: <i>Athena</i>, <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Artemis</i>, <i>Ares</i>, <i> Aphrodite</i>, <i>Hephaestus</i>, <i> Hermes</i>, and <i>Dionysus</i>. </p>
    <p> Although <i>Hades</i> was a major deity in the Greek pantheon, and was the brother of <i>Zeus</i> and the other first generation of Olympians, his realm was far away from Olympus in the underworld, and thus he was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians. </p>
    <p> Olympic gods can be contrasted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chthonic"> chthonic gods</a>, including <i>Hades</i>, by mode of sacrifice, the latter receiving sacrifices in a <i lang="el"> bothros</i> ("pit") or <i lang="el"> megaron </i> ("sunken chamber") rather than at an altar. </p>
    <p> The canonical number of Olympian gods was twelve, but besides the (thirteen) principal Olympians listed above, there were many other residents of Olympus, who thus might be considered to be Olympians.</p>
    <p> <i>Heracles</i> became a resident of Olympus after his apotheosis and married another Olympian resident <i>Hebe</i>.</p>
    <p> According to Hesiod, the children of <i>Styx</i>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelus"> <i>Zelus</i></a> (Envy), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_(mythology)"><i>Nike</i></a> (Victory), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_(mythology)"><i>Cratos</i></a> (Power), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia_(mythology)"><i>Bia</i></a> (Force), <i>"have no house apart from <i>Zeus</i>, nor any dwelling nor path except that wherein God leads them, but they dwell always with <i>Zeus</i>.</i>"</p>
    <p> Some others who might be considered Olympians, include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muses"><i>the Muses</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charites"><i>the Graces</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(mythology)"><i>Iris</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_(Titaness)"> <i>Dione</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileithyia"> <i>Eileithyia</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horae"><i>the Horae</i></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(mythology)"><i>Ganymede</i></a>.</p>
